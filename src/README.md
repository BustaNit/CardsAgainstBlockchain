We forked this repository from Cards Against Cryptography at https://github.com/CardsAgainstCryptography/CAC  We have a git submodule of their repository in ../CAC if you want to print their cards as well, but you could also copy the card files in ../CAC/src/*.txt into this directory if you want to build their decks and our deck together.
